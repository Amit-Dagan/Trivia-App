# Trivia App 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Trivia App, an interactive platform where users can answer trivia questions and contribute there own questions. The application is designed with Flutter for the front end, utilizing AWS services such as Lambda, RDS, and DynamoDB for the backend infrastructure. This project enables users to upload questions to the database, track their scores, and engage in a fun and challenging trivia experience.

## Project Status

I need to address several issues in this project before making it publicly available. Unfortunately, due to unexpected costs, I had to delete the database, rendering the application temporarily unavailable. The goal is to fix the existing problems, optimize the codebase according to best practices, and reinstate the project to its operational state.

## Project Components

### Frontend (Flutter)
The Trivia App's user interface is built using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter provides a responsive and visually appealing user experience across different platforms.

### Backend (AWS Services)
The backend of the Trivia App is powered by AWS (Amazon Web Services). The key components include:

- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless computing is achieved using Lambda functions. These functions handle various tasks, including question submission, and scoring.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** The database management is handled by RDS, ensuring a scalable and reliable storage solution trivia questions.

- **DynamoDB:** DynamoDB is utilized for efficient and fast NoSQL data storage, providing a robust foundation for storing users data.

## Next Steps

To revive the Trivia App and ensure its optimal performance, the following steps need to be taken:

1. **Database Configuration:** Reconfigure the database settings and schema to ensure proper data storage and retrieval.

2. **Cost Optimization:** Review and optimize AWS resource usage to prevent unexpected costs and enhance the overall efficiency of the application.

3. **Code Refactoring:** Implement best practices and refactor the codebase for improved maintainability, readability, and performance.

4. **Documentation:** Enhance project documentation to provide clear instructions for future developers and users.
